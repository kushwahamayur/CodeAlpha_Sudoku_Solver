Here are the projects which i have done in my virtual internship with #codealpha. Thankyou CodeAlpha for giving me this opportunity. Following were the task assigned:

Task:- Sudoku Solver

This C++ program solves a Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm. The program:

1. Defines functions to print the Sudoku grid, check the validity of numbers, and recursively solve the puzzle.
2. Uses backtracking to try placing each number in empty cells and checks if it leads to a solution.
3. If a solution is found, it prints the solved board; if not, it prints that no solution exists.

This solution is efficient for solving standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles and demonstrates a typical use of recursion and backtracking for constraint satisfaction problems.
